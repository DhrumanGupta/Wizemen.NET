# Introduction  
## Looking to get started?  
Welcome! Before you give into this library, you should have *basic* understanding of the language you are about to use. To properly use this library, you need to understand fairly basic topics such as [exceptions and exception handling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/exceptions/) and [asynchronous methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/).  

## New to .NET/C#?  

All examples or snippets featured in this guide and all API documentation will be written in C#.
